Package Level
=============

All packages for all games have their own levels.
There are 5 levels:
1: Easy
2: Relatively easy
3: Normal
4: Relatively hard
5: Hard

The level of package is judged by me at first time.
It may change in the future.
For example, although the level of a transcription packaeg is 5,
many users can solve it without giving up.
Then the level decreases to 1-3.
