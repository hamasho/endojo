    <h1>Vocabulary Game</h1>
    
    <p>
    Vocabulary is the foundation of English.
    Without enough vocabulary,
    although you have knowledge of grammer,
    you cannot understand any English sentences.
    Additionally, you cannot write or speak your ideas.
    Your English skills will improve in every way
    by increasing your vocabulary.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this game, we use the brain mechanism of memorization.
    Your brain lost memory over time.
    Things you just remember at first time are forgotten rapidly.
    But if you remember again before you completely forget it,
    the forgetting speed will reduce.
    By repeating this process,
    your memory become strong and finally
    you will never forget it.
    </p>

    <p>
    This web application manages all learning words.
    In the first period of a learning word,
    the word appears frequently in vocabulary game
    to make strong memorization.
    So you can easily remember the word.
    As time proceeds, the frequency will reduce.
    Because you have almost remembered the word in this phase,
    it's no problem.
    Finally, you remember the word completely.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this game,
    all words are separated into 'known' or 'unknown' state.
    And all 'unknown' words are separated into 5 state.
    First, the unknown word is classified as 'state 1',
    which means it's the first period of memorizing process.
    If you remember this word correctly,
    then the word state becomes 2 and it will appears after 1 day.
    If you also remember the word at that time,
    the state increases to 3 and it will appears after 2 day.
    As the state increases,
    the duration between appearing gets longer.
    Finally, if the state reaches 6,
    the word will be marked as 'remember'.
