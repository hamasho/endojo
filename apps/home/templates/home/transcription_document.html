    <h1>Transcription Game</h1>
    
    <p>
    Which sentence can you remember easily?
    </p>
    <ul class="p-ul">
      <li>How are you doing?</li>
      <li>o?rwH i eydongao u</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Althoug both sentences use the same characters,
    the first one is easier to remember.
    This is because you remember the sentence by its meaning,
    rather than its notation.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this game,
    you remember and write down some sentences.
    In this process, you are forced to remember all words
    and structures in the sentence,
    which causes the following effects;
    </p>
    <ul class="p-ul">
      <li>You read sentences very carefully,</li>
      <li>List of 'Sentence Structures' in your memory increases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Especially, the second reason is important and
    it increases your English skills dramatically.
    When inputting, it is easy to understand sentences
    if you already know the structure of those.
    When outputting, all you have to do is convert your ideas to
    expressions you already know.
    In short, all of your English skills,
    reading, writing, listening and speaking,
    will be improved dramatically by this game.
    </p>
    <p>
    You may feel tired to play this game
    because it's hard to remember sentences completely.
    But never give up.
    If you continue it,
    you will finally obtain strong foundation of your English skills.
