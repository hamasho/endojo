  <h1>Transcription Game</h1>

  <p>
  Which sentence can you remember easily?
  <ul>
    <li>How are you doing?</li>
    <li>o?rwH i eydongao u</li>
  </ul>
  Althoug both sentences use the same characters,
  the first one is easier to remember.
  This is because you remember the sentence by its meaning,
  rather than its notation.
  </p>
  <p>
  In this game,
  you have to remember a sentence and write down it.
  In this process, you are forced to remember all words
  the sentence.
